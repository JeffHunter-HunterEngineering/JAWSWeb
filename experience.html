                        <h3>Office Building - Scottsdale, Arizona</h3>
                        <p>This project consisted of a two-story office building in Scottsdale, Arizona.  This project was unique because it was an infill site which was originally designed as a second phase of development within an existing parking lot. This was a ground-up facility currently under management by our firm, currently the building is a single tenant, long term veterinary hospital.  Scope: Site selection, Due-diligence, Planning, Construction, Lease up and Property Management.</p>

                <h3>Industrial Building - Mesa, Arizona</h3>
                <p>This project is a large rear loaded industrial facility in Mesa, Arizona.  This project is unique because of the access condition.  The Town of Queen Creek owns the frontage road and a private developer owns the west access drive so access was tough to obtain for the project.  Construction is anticipated in the second quarter 2024.  Scope includes Site selection, Due-diligence, Planning, Engineering, Construction, and Lease up.</p>

                        <p>This was originally purchased for development and then the recession hit. Because of the turbulent market at the time, we signed a development agreement and ground lease with Enterprise for a truck rental facility in Phoenix, Arizona.  The project was fully improvement and currently has a long-term lease.  The project is unique because it was purchased for development and ended up becoming a ground lease.  Scope includes Site selection, Due-diligence, Planning, Rezoning, Engineering and Property Management.</p>

This project was unique because it won the Green Storage Facility of the Year award by Self Storage Magazine. This was a ground-up facility and was managed by our firm and then ultimately sold to Public Storage after 93% stabilization.
